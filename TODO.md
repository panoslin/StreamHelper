- **Binary Management**: Bundle platform-specific yt-dlp binaries (win32, darwin, linux)
- **Platform Detection**: Implement OS detection for correct binary path resolution
- **Progress Parsing**: Parse yt-dlp stdout/stderr for real-time progress updates
- **Error Handling**: Handle yt-dlp execution errors and provide user feedback
- **Binary Updates**: Plan strategy for updating yt-dlp binaries (bundled vs dynamic)
- **Permissions**: Handle executable permissions on Unix-like systems

### User Experience Considerations
- **Simplicity**: Keep the interface intuitive and easy to use
- **Feedback**: Provide clear status updates and progress information
- **Flexibility**: Allow users to customize download preferences
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the application is accessible to all users

**Estimated Timeline**: 8-12 weeks for complete implementation
**Team Size**: 2-3 developers recommended
**Complexity**: Medium to High

## üèóÔ∏è Industry Best Practices for System Design

### 3.8.1 Architecture Principles
- [ ] **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between main process, renderer, and shared modules
- [ ] **Dependency Injection**: Use Angular's built-in DI container for service management
- [ ] **Single Responsibility**: Each service/component has one clear purpose
- [ ] **Interface Segregation**: Define clear contracts between modules
- [ ] **Open/Closed Principle**: Extend functionality without modifying existing code

### 3.8.2 Security Best Practices
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Validate all messages from extension and user inputs
- [ ] **Authentication**: Implement secure communication between extension and client
- [ ] **File System Security**: Sanitize file paths and restrict access to authorized directories
- [ ] **Binary Execution**: Validate yt-dlp binary integrity before execution
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Never expose sensitive information in error messages

### 3.8.3 Performance Best Practices
- [ ] **Lazy Loading**: Load Angular modules and components on-demand
- [ ] **Change Detection Strategy**: Use OnPush strategy for performance-critical components
- [ ] **Memory Management**: Properly dispose of subscriptions and event listeners
- [ ] **Binary Caching**: Cache yt-dlp binary paths and validation results
- [ ] **Download Queue Optimization**: Implement intelligent queue management with priority levels

### 3.8.4 Testing Strategy
- [ ] **Unit Testing**: Test individual services and components in isolation
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Test communication between main and renderer processes
- [ ] **E2E Testing**: Test complete user workflows
- [ ] **Performance Testing**: Monitor memory usage and download performance
- [ ] **Cross-Platform Testing**: Test on all target operating systems

### 3.8.5 Error Handling & Resilience
- [ ] **Graceful Degradation**: App continues working even if some features fail
- [ ] **Retry Mechanisms**: Implement exponential backoff for failed operations
- [ ] **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevent cascading failures in download operations
- [ ] **Comprehensive Logging**: Log all operations for debugging and monitoring
- [ ] **User Feedback**: Provide clear error messages and recovery suggestions

### 3.8.6 Code Quality & Documentation Standards
- [ ] **Function Documentation**: Every function must have JSDoc comments explaining its purpose, parameters, and return values
- [ ] **Inline Comments**: Add brief inline comments for complex logic and business rules
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Document all service methods and their usage
- [ ] **Component Documentation**: Document component inputs, outputs, and lifecycle methods
- [ ] **README Updates**: Keep project documentation current with setup and usage instructions

### 3.8.7 Project Organization & Asset Management
- [ ] **Structured File Organization**: Organize all project files in logical, hierarchical folders
- [ ] **Asset Management**: Create dedicated folders for images, icons, and other media files
- [ ] **Binary Management**: Organize yt-dlp binaries in platform-specific folders with version tracking
- [ ] **Documentation Structure**: Maintain organized documentation with clear navigation
- [ ] **Resource Organization**: Organize PrimeNG themes, custom styles, and shared resources
